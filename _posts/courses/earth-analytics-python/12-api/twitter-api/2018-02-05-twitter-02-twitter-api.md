## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Query the twitter RESTful API to access and import into `Python` tweets that contain various text strings.
* Generate a list of users who are tweeting about a particular topic.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

You will need a computer with internet access to complete this lesson.

</div>


In this lesson you will explore analyzing social media data accessed from twitter,
in Python. You  will use the Twitter RESTful API to access data about both twitter users
and what they are tweeting about. 

## Getting Started

To get started you'll need to do the following things:

1. Set up a twitter account if you don't have one already.
2. Using your account, setup an application that you will use to access twitter from `Python`
3. Import the `tweepy` package

Once you've done these things, you are ready to begin querying Twitter's API to
see what you can learn about tweets!

## Set up Twitter App 

Get started by setting up an application in twitter that you can use to access tweets. Make sure you already have a twitter account. To setup your app, follow the documentation from `rtweet` here:

<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/vignettes/auth.html" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
 TUTORIAL: How to setup a twitter application using your twitter account</a>

NOTE: you will need to provide your cell phone number to twitter to verify your
use of the API.

</figure>


## Access Twitter API in Python 

Once you have your twitter app setup, you are ready to dive into accessing tweets in `Python`. Begin by importing the necessary `Python` libraries. 

{:.input}
```python
import tweepy
import pandas as pd
```

To access the Twitter API you will need 4 things from the your Twitter App page. These keys are located in your twitter app settings in the `Keys and Access Tokens` tab.

* consumer key
* consumer seceret key
* access token key 
* access token secret key 

Do not share these with anyone else because these values are specific to your app. 

First you will need define your keys

```Python
consumer_key= 'yourkeyhere'
consumer_secret= 'yourkeyhere'
access_token= 'yourkeyhere'
access_token_secret= 'yourkeyhere'
```

{:.input}
```python
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth,wait_on_rate_limit=True)
```

### Send a Tweet

Note that your tweet needs to be 140 characters or less.

```python
# post a tweet from Python
api.update_status("Look, I'm tweeting from Python in my #earthanalytics class! @EarthLabCU")
# your tweet has been posted!
```

### Search Twitter for Tweets

Now you are ready to search twitter for recent tweets! Let's start by finding all
tweets that use the `#boco_trails` hashtag.

{:.input}
```python
for tweet in tweepy.Cursor(api.search,q="#boco_trails",
                           lang="en",
                           since="2018-05-20", include_rts=False).items():
    print (tweet.created_at, tweet.text)
```

{:.input}
```python
q="#boco_trails -filter:retweets"
```


## Retweets

A retweet is when you or someone else shares someone elses tweet so your / their
followers can see it. It is similar to sharing in Facebook where you can add a
quote or text above the retweet if you want or just share the post. Let's use
the same query that you used above but this time ignore all retweets by adding -filer:retweets to your querry. 
The [twitter API documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/rules-and-filtering/overview/standard-operators) has information on other ways to customize your querries. 


{:.input}
```python
for tweet in tweepy.Cursor(api.search, q="#boco_trails -filter:retweets",
                           lang="en",

## Putting Data from Twitter into `Pandas Dataframe`

Now you work with `pandas` to organize tweets from your API querry into a dataframe. 

{:.input}
```python
data = pd.DataFrame(data=[tweet.text for tweet in tweets], columns=['Tweets'])
```

{:.input}
```python
tweet_list = []

                           lang="en",
                           since="2018-05-20").items():
  tweet_list.append(tweet) 
```

{:.input}
```python
len(tweet_list)
```

    df['user'] = [tweet.user.name for tweet in tweet_l]
