## Multispectral Imagery in Python

### Introduction to Multi-Band Raster Data

In the previous weeks, you have worked with raster data derived from lidar remote sensing
instruments. These rasters consisted of one layer or band and contained information
height values derived from lidar data. In this lesson, you will
learn how to work with rasters containing multispectral imagery data stored within
multiple bands (or layers) in `Python`.

Just like we did with single band rasters, we can use the `rasterio.open()` function to open multi band raster data in `Python`.  

* To import multi-band raster data you will use the `stack()` function.
* If your multi-band data are imagery that you wish to composite, you can use
`plotRGB()`, instead of `plot()`, to plot a 3 band raster image.

## What is Multispectral Imagery?

One type of multispectral imagery that is familiar to many of us is a color
image. A color image consists of three bands: red, green, and blue. Each
band represents light reflected from the red, green or blue portions of the
electromagnetic spectrum. The pixel brightness for each band, when composited
creates the colors that you see in an image. These colors are the ones your eyes
can see within the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

</figure>

You can plot each band of a multi-band image individually using a grayscale
color gradient. Remember from the videos that you watched in class that the
LIGHTER colors represent a stronger reflection
in that band. DARKER colors represent a weaker reflection.

#### Each band plotted separately

Note there are four bands below. You are looking at the red, green, blue and Near
infrared bands of a NAIP image. What do you notice about the relative darkness /
lightness of each image? Is one image brighter than the other?

</figure>




You can plot the red, green and blue bands together to create an RGB image. This is
what you would see with our eyes if you were in the airplane looking down at the earth.


## CIR Image

If the image has a 4th NIR band, you can create a CIR (sometimes called false color)
image. In a color infrared image, the NIR band is plotted on the "red" band. Thus vegetation, which reflects strongly in the NIR part of the spectrum, is colored "red".

## Other Types of Multi-band Raster Data

Multi-band raster data might also contain:

1. **Time series:** the same variable, over the same area, over time.
2. **Multi or hyperspectral imagery:** image rasters that have 4 or more (multi-spectral) or more than 10-15 (hyperspectral) bands.

We will work with time series data later in the semester.

## Work with NAIP data in Python

Now, we have learned that basic concepts associated with a multi-band raster. Next,
let's explore some spectral imagery in `Python` to better understand our study site -
which is the cold springs fire scare in Colorado near Nederland.



### About NAIP:

In this lesson, you will work with NAIP data.

>The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.

> NAIP is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office in Salt Lake City. This "leaf-on" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. -- USDA NAIP Program

<a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/" target="_blank">Read more about NAIP</a>

NAIP is a great source of high resolution imagery across the United States.
NAIP imagery is often collected with just a red, green and Blue band. However,
some flights include a near infrared band which is very useful for quantifying
vegetation cover and health.

NAIP data access: The data used in this lesson were downloaded from the <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">USGS Earth explorer website. </a>

## Open NAIP Data in Python

Next, you will use NAIP imagery for the Coldsprings fire study area in
Colorado. To work with multi-band raster data you will use the `rasterio` and `geopandas`
packages. You will also use the `spatial` module from the `earthpy` package for raster plotting.

Before you get started, make sure that your working directory is set.


{:.input}
```python
import rasterio as rio
import geopandas as gpd
import earthpy as et
import earthpy.spatial as es
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
from rasterio.plot import show
import numpy as np
plt.ion()
# set working directory to your home dir/earth-analytics
os.chdir(os.path.join(et.io.HOME, 'earth-analytics'))

mpl.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 10)
mpl.rcParams['axes.titlesize'] = 20
```

To begin, you will use the rasterio open function to open the multi-band NAIP image

`rio.open("path-to-tif-file-here")`

Remember that it is ideal to use a context manager to open raster data in Python.
This ensures that the data connection is properly closed. 

`with rio.open("path-here") as src:`

Where `src` can be whatever variable name you select to store the raster object.

{:.input}
```python
with rio.open("data/cold-springs-fire/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20150919/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20150919_crop.tif") as src:
    naip_csf = src.read()
    naip_csf_meta = src.meta

```

You can plot a single band in the NAIP raster using `imshow()`. Note that we set the color ramp to 
greyscale using the `cmap` argument. 

{:.input}
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(naip_csf[0], cmap='Greys')
ax.set(title="NAIP RGB Imagery - Band 1-Red\nCold Springs Fire Scar", 
       xticks=[], yticks=[]);
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}//images/courses/earth-analytics-python/07-multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/01-multi-spectral-remote-sensing-python/2018-04-14-multispectral02-open-NAIP-imagery-in-python_15_0.png">

</figure>




Or you can use the earthpy function `plot_bands()`. Keep in mind that the `earthpy` package was developed to make it a bit easier to work with spatial data in `Python`. 

{:.input}
```python
es.plot_bands(naip_csf[0], 
              title="NAIP RGB Imagery - Band 1-Red\nCold Springs Fire Scar")
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}//images/courses/earth-analytics-python/07-multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/01-multi-spectral-remote-sensing-python/2018-04-14-multispectral02-open-NAIP-imagery-in-python_17_0.png">

</figure>




You use the `.meta` attribute to view the metadata associated with your raster.
The output of this is a disctionary of attributes including the number of bands (count), the coordinate reference system (crs), the assigned no data value and more. 


{:.input}
```python
naip_csf_meta
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    {'affine': Affine(1.0, 0.0, 457163.0,
           0.0, -1.0, 4426952.0),
     'count': 4,
     'crs': CRS({'proj': 'utm', 'zone': 13, 'ellps': 'GRS80', 'towgs84': '0,0,0,0,0,0,0', 'units': 'm', 'no_defs': True}),
     'driver': 'GTiff',
     'dtype': 'int16',
     'height': 2312,
     'nodata': -32768.0,
     'transform': (457163.0, 1.0, 0.0, 4426952.0, 0.0, -1.0),
     'width': 4377}






<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Remember that a tiff can store 1 or more bands. It's unusual to find tif files with more than 4 bands.
{: .notice--success}

### Image Raster Data Values
Next, examine the raster's min and max values. What is the value range?


{:.input}
```python
# view min and max value
print(naip_csf.min())
print(naip_csf.max())
```

{:.output}
    17
    242



This raster contains values between 0 and 255. These values represent degrees of brightness associated with the image band. In the case of a RGB image (red, green and blue), band 1 is the red band. When we plot the red band, larger numbers (towards 255) represent pixels with more red in them (a strong red reflection). Smaller numbers (towards 0) represent pixels with less red in them (less red was reflected). To plot an RGB image, we mix red + green + blue values, using the ratio of each. The ratio of each color is determined by how much light was recorded (the reflectance value) in each band. This mixture creates one single color than inturn makes up the full color image - similar to the color image your camera phone creates.

## 8 vs 16 Bit Images

It's important to note that this image is an 8 bit image. This means that all values in the raster are stored within a range of 0:255. Thus the brightest whites will be at or close to 255. The darkest values in each band will be closer to 0.

### Import A Specific Band

You use the `naip_csf.read()[1]` function to import specific bands in our raster object
by specifying which band we want with `[band-number-here]` 

To import the green band, you use `[1]`. Remember that Python uses 0-based indexing so band 1 is actually band "2" as you would count on your fingers. 

{:.input}
```python
rgb_band2 = naip_csf[1]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(rgb_band2, cmap='Greys')
ax.set(title="RGB Imagery - Band 2 - Green\nCold Springs Fire Scar", 
       xticks=[], yticks=[]);
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

</figure>




## Rasters and Numpy Arrays

When you import a raster dataset into Python, the data are quickly converted to a numpy array. A numpy array has no inherent spatial information attached to it and is just a matrix or values. This makes processing the data fast.

The spatial information for the raster is stored in a .meta attribute and allows you to eventually export the data as a geotiff or other spatial format after you are done working with it. 

### Raster Band Attributes

You can explore your data in python using the same sorts of descriptive statistics that you would use with any other data. For instance you can get the min and max values for the first band in your array using `np.min()` and `np.max()`

{:.input}
```python
# What kinds of attributes would these be? Just min/max/etc?
# we'd access a band like this:

print("max value:", np.max(naip_csf[0]))
print("min value:", np.min(naip_csf[0]))
```

{:.output}
    max value: 239
    min value: 32




### Raster Histograms

You view a histogram of each band in your data using a matplotlib plot. Below, you loop through each band or layer in the number array and plot the distribution of reflectance values. 


{:.input}
```python
# view a few values in the data 
band_2 = naip_csf[1]
band_2
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    array([[114, 114, 126, ...,  58,  54,  72],
           [114, 112, 120, ...,  70,  60,  58],
           [111, 114, 115, ...,  85,  87,  58],
           ...,
           [183, 184, 185, ...,  61,  75,  84],
           [184, 185, 185, ...,  56,  66,  78],
           [186, 186, 186, ...,  52,  58,  65]], dtype=int16)





{:.input}
```python
band_2.ravel()
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    array([114, 114, 126, ...,  52,  58,  65], dtype=int16)





{:.input}
```python
# plot histogram
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,6))
ax.hist(band_2.ravel(), 
        bins = 20, 
        color = 'purple')
ax.set_title("Histogram of NAIP Band 2 (Green Band)");
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}//images/courses/earth-analytics-python/07-multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/01-multi-spectral-remote-sensing-python/2018-04-14-multispectral02-open-NAIP-imagery-in-python_29_0.png">

</figure>




{:.input}
```python
# plot 
first_band = naip_csf[0]
first_band
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    array([[113, 117, 137, ...,  54,  51,  74],
           [113, 117, 131, ...,  63,  54,  54],
           [111, 117, 120, ...,  78,  76,  52],
           ...,
           [191, 192, 193, ...,  58,  69,  76],
           [192, 192, 193, ...,  53,  62,  71],
           [193, 193, 193, ...,  51,  59,  66]], dtype=int16)





Then plot the histogram.

{:.input}
```python
# plot histogram
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,6))
# plot histogram
ax.hist(first_band.ravel(), 
        range=[np.nanmin(first_band), np.nanmax(first_band)], 
        bins=20, 
        color='purple')
ax.set_title("Histogram of reflectance values in the first NAIP band", 
             fontsize=16);
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}//images/courses/earth-analytics-python/07-multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/01-multi-spectral-remote-sensing-python/2018-04-14-multispectral02-open-NAIP-imagery-in-python_32_0.png">

</figure>




Or you can loop through all of the bands and plot the histogram for each one. 
Notice below you are coloring the bins for each histogram according to the band "color". 
NIR is represented in black; it is not a color visible to the human eye! 

{:.input}
```python
colors = ["purple", "green"]
len(colors)
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    2





{:.input}
```python
colors = ['r', 'g', 'b', 'k']
titles = ['red band','green band','blue band','nir band']
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10, 10), sharex=True, sharey=True)
for band, color, the_title, ax in zip(naip_csf, colors, titles, axs.ravel()):
    ax.hist(band.ravel(), bins=20, color=color, alpha=.8)
    ax.set_title(the_title)
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}//images/courses/earth-analytics-python/07-multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/01-multi-spectral-remote-sensing-python/2018-04-14-multispectral02-open-NAIP-imagery-in-python_35_0.png">

</figure>




You can use the `hist()` function in earthpy to plot histograms for all bands in your raster as well.

{:.input}
```python
colors = ['r', 'g', 'b', 'k']
titles = ['red band','green band','blue band','nir band']
es.hist(naip_csf, colors=colors, titles = titles)
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}//images/courses/earth-analytics-python/07-multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/01-multi-spectral-remote-sensing-python/2018-04-14-multispectral02-open-NAIP-imagery-in-python_37_0.png">

</figure>




You can create histograms using rasterio objects and the rasterio `show_hist()` function too. You may notice that for some datasets, this is a bit slower than using numpy as presented above. 

{:.input}
```python
# import the hist function from rasterio 
from rasterio.plot import show_hist

src = rio.open("data/cold-springs-fire/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20150919/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20150919_crop.tif")
show_hist(
   src, bins=50, lw=0.0, 
    stacked=False, alpha=0.3,
    histtype='stepfilled', title="Histogram of Raster Values for Each NAIP Band")
# be sure to close the data source if you open it this way
src.close()
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}//images/courses/earth-analytics-python/07-multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/01-multi-spectral-remote-sensing-python/2018-04-14-multispectral02-open-NAIP-imagery-in-python_39_0.png">

</figure>





### Plot Raster Band Images

Below, you plot each band in the raster image individually. For each band "color", the brightest pixels are represented in a grayscale range as "white". The darkest pixels are darker to black in color. The code below shows you how to create loops necessary to plot each band in matplotlib. 



{:.input}
```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(20, 10))
for ax, band, the_title in zip(axs.ravel(), naip_csf, titles):
    ax.imshow(band, cmap='Greys')
    ax.set(xticks=[], yticks=[])
    ax.set_title(the_title)
plt.tight_layout()
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}//images/courses/earth-analytics-python/07-multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/01-multi-spectral-remote-sensing-python/2018-04-14-multispectral02-open-NAIP-imagery-in-python_41_0.png">

</figure>




However you can also use the earthpy `plot_bands()` function to plot the data

{:.input}
```python
# plot all bands using the earthpy function
es.plot_bands(naip_csf, title = titles,
             figsize=(12,5), cols=2)
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}//images/courses/earth-analytics-python/07-multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/01-multi-spectral-remote-sensing-python/2018-04-14-multispectral02-open-NAIP-imagery-in-python_43_0.png">

</figure>




Or you can just plot one single band. 

{:.input}
```python
# plot using matplotlib
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(naip_csf[1], cmap='Greys')
ax.set(title="NAIP Band 2\n Coldsprings Fire Site", 
       xticks=[], yticks=[]);
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}//images/courses/earth-analytics-python/07-multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/01-multi-spectral-remote-sensing-python/2018-04-14-multispectral02-open-NAIP-imagery-in-python_45_0.png">

</figure>




### Plot Bands Using Earthpy

You can use the earthpy package to plot a single or all bands in your array. 
To use earthpy call:

`es.plot_bands()`

plot_bands() takes the following arguments:

* title: A single title for one band or a list of x titles for x bands in your array
* figsize: a tutple of 2 values representing the x and y dimensions of the image.
* cmap: the colormap that you'd like to use to plot the raster. Default is greyscale
* cols: if you are plotting more than one band you can specify the number of columns in the grid that you'd like to plot. 


{:.input}
```python
# plot using earthpy
es.plot_bands(naip_csf[1], 
             title = "Single band plot")
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}//images/courses/earth-analytics-python/07-multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/01-multi-spectral-remote-sensing-python/2018-04-14-multispectral02-open-NAIP-imagery-in-python_47_0.png">

</figure>




### Plot All Bands Function

The earthpy module features a function that will quickly plot each band independently to help you explore the data. To use this function you

1. provide a numpy array in rasterio band order (band dimension is first)
and then optionally provide

* the x , y dimension of your figure (figa, figb)
* an array of titles for each image

{:.input}
```python
es.plot_bands(naip_csf,
              figsize = (10, 5))
```

healthy leaves reflect MORE green light compared to red light however the brightest values should be in the NIR band.-->

## Plot RGB Data in Python


Previously you have plotted individual bands using a greyscale color ramp in Python. Next, you will learn how to plot an RGB composite image. This type of image is similar in appearance to one you capture using a cell phone or digital camera.

To render a 3 band, color image in `Python`, you can use the `imshow()` function. 
`Imshow` allows you to identify what bands you want to render in the red, green and blue regions. 

To ensure that the image plots and is scalled correctly, you will use the `bytescale()` function which used to be a part of sci-py / sci-image. Scipy deprecate this function so we've added it to the `earthpy` package for you to use in this course

The code will look something like this:

`ax.imshow(es.bytescale(naip_csf.read())[:3].transpose([1, 2, 0]))`

where

* `ax.imshow()` is the call to plot the image
* `es.bystescale()` ensures that the values in the image are stretched between 0 and 255 which is the range that our monitor can recognize. 

IMPORTANT: when plotting in python, it is important that you TRANSPOSE the data.
The data are read in with the bands FIRST and then the rows and columns. however imshow expects to find the individual bands last. We adjust the dimensions of the data using:

`transpose([])`


{:.input}
```python
# plot the first 3 bands of the raster (r,g,b bands)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(es.bytescale(naip_csf)[:3].transpose([1, 2, 0]));

```

</figure>




You can customized your plot by removing the ticks and adding a title using `ax.set()`.

* `xticks=[], yticks=[]`: turn off plot "ticks"


{:.input}
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(es.bytescale(naip_csf)[:3].transpose([1, 2, 0]))
ax.set(title="RGB Composite Image \nCold Springs Fire Scar, Nederland, Colorado", 
       xticks=[], yticks=[]);
```

The Earth Py Python module has a function called plot_rgb that makes plotting even easier.
To use it

1. provide a numpy array in rasterio band order (bands first)




{:.input}
```python
es.plot_rgb(naip_csf)
```

{:.output}

</figure>




Optionally, you can also provide the bands that you wish to plot, the title and the figure size.



{:.input}
```python
es.plot_rgb(naip_csf, title ="CIR NAIP image",
                   rgb = [3,0,1], 
                    figsize = (10, 8))

The image above looks pretty good. You can explore whether applying a stretch to
the image improves clarity and contrast.

Below you use the skimage package to contrast stretch each band in your data to make the whites more bright and the blacks more dark. 

In the example below you only stretch bands 0,1 and 2 which are the RGB bands. To begin you

1. preallocate and array of zeros that is the same shape as your numpy array
2. then you look through each band in the image and rescale it

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Read more about image stretch on the <a href="http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/color_exposure/plot_equalize.html" target = "_blank">scikit-image website</a>.

{:.input}
```python
from skimage import exposure

# identify the bands that you wish to stretch
# skip this step if you wish to stretch all bands
band_indices = [0, 1, 2]
naip_csf_images = naip_csf[band_indices]

# Preallocate a new array of zeros
naip_csf_images_rescaled = np.zeros_like(naip_csf_images)
for ii, band in enumerate(naip_csf_images):
    p2, p98 = np.percentile(band, (2, 98))
    naip_csf_images_rescaled[ii] = exposure.rescale_intensity(band, in_range=(p2, p98))
    
# stretch the image using contrast stretching 
# http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/color_exposure/plot_equalize.html

es.plot_rgb(naip_csf_images_rescaled, 
                    title ="CIR NAIP image\n Stretch Applied",

For convenience we have also built a stretch feature into `earthpy`. You can call it using the stretch argument.

{:.input}
```python
# apply stretch using the earthpy plot_rgb function
es.plot_rgb(naip_csf, 
            rgb = band_indices,
            title ="CIR NAIP image\n Stretch Applied", 
            figsize = (10, 8),
            stretch=True)

What does the image look like using a different stretch? Any better? worse?

In this case, the stretch does increase the contrast in our image. 
However visually it may or may not be what you want to plot.
